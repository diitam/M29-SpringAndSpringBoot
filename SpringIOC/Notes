SPring Framework-It is a framework where we can develop java application
benifit-simplicity
	-testability
	-loose coupling(it allows u to change the implementation of two related 			objects without affecting other objects).

Spring IO platform has 3 layers
1. Foundation Layer-it contains set of APIs which can be used to build an application

2.Coordination Layer-provides APIs to connect with cloud services with spring cloud

3.Execution Layer helps to avoid deployment to an external container like tomcat server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is IOC(Inversion Of Control)
-IOC,it is heart of spring framework
-Inversion of responsibility with regard to how an object contain references to collaborating objects .

Agenda of springIOC
-we should not touch source code 
-this application is configurable ie...it should be upgradable


spring framework-can create object for u using getbean("a") method
		-it can manage objects for u.

IOC Container-
1.Bean Factory
2.Application Context

To implement all the methods which is inside that interface we have implementable class-ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
