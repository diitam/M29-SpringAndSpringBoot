Dependency injection-The data initialization depends on another class that we are going to inject using spring framework.
		    -It is pattern through which IOC is achieved.
		    -Spring core module is responsible for injecting dependencies through either constructor or setter method.
pre-requisite-Spring IOC Concept


Dependency Injection Types-DI Literal
			  -DI Obj
			  -DI Collection
We can achieve Dependency Injection by 2 ways-Setters(beans.xml<property>)   
					     -Constructor(beans.xml<constructor-arg>)
setterDI-->poor readability(boilerplate code)
	 ->must include getter and setter

constructor DI-->good readability
	       ->bean class must declare a matching constructor with argument.
